     <h class="display-1"> Coffee Shop</h>
     <p class="class-lead">A coffee Shop, is an establishment that primarily serves various types of coffee, espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Some coffeeshop may serve cold drinks, such as iced coffee and iced tea, as well as other non-caffeinated beverages. A coffeeshop may also serve food, such as light snacks, sandwiches, muffins, fruit, or pastries. In continental Europe, some cafés also serve alcoholic beverages. Coffeeshops range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations. Some coffeeshop chains operate on a franchise business model, with numerous branches across various countries around the world.</p>
     <p class="class">While café may refer to a coffeeshop, the term "café" generally refers to a diner, British café (colloquially called a "caff"), "greasy spoon" (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café, teahouse or tea room, or other casual eating and drinking place.A coffeeshop may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. Many Coffeeshops in the Middle East and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world offer shisha (actually called nargile in Levantine Arabic, Greek, and Turkish), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah. An espresso bar is a type of coffeeshop that specializes in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.</p>
